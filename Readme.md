# Fake News Classifier  

This project is a deep learning-based **Fake News Classifier** built using **LSTM** and **Bidirectional LSTM**. It was created primarily to enhance my understanding of NLP, text classification, and deep learning architectures. The models analyze news article titiles and classify them as **real** or **fake** based on textual features.  

## Features  
- âœ… Preprocessing using **NLTK** (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)  
- âœ… LSTM-based deep learning model for classification  
- âœ… Experimentation with **Bidirectional LSTM** for improved accuracy  

## Dataset  
The dataset used is a publicly available **Fake News Dataset**, consisting of labeled news articles. It contains **headline, text, and label (fake or real)**.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nikhil-1705/Fake_news_classifier.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the notebook and execute the cells to preprocess data, train the model, and test predictions.  

## Future Improvements  
- Experimenting with **transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa)**  
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
- Deploying as a **web app** for real-time news verification  

## Note  
This project was made **for learning purposes** and to improve my understanding of NLP and deep learning. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! ðŸ˜Š
