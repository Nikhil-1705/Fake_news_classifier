Fake News Classifier
A deep learning model for detecting fake news using LSTM. The model processes textual data, extracts features, and classifies news articles as real or fake. Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras with NLP preprocessing techniques.

Bidirectional LSTM Fake News Classifier
An improved version of the Fake News Classifier using Bidirectional LSTM for enhanced text understanding. This model captures both past and future context in sequences, improving accuracy in fake news detection.

Fake News Classifier
This project is a deep learning-based Fake News Classifier built using LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM. It was created primarily to enhance my understanding of NLP, text classification, and deep learning architectures. The models analyze news articles and classify them as real or fake based on textual features.

Features
âœ… Preprocessing using NLTK (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
âœ… LSTM-based deep learning model for classification
âœ… Experimentation with Bidirectional LSTM for improved accuracy

Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available Fake News Dataset, consisting of labeled news articles. It contains headline, text, and label (fake or real).
